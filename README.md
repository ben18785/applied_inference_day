# Introduction to applied inference

This course contains materials for an introduction to applied inference course. The course has the following structure:

* AM: Lecture on "Basic MCMC algorithms and formulating the ODE inference problem", which covers:
  * the Random walk metropolis algorithm
  * how to judge convergence of MCMC algorithms
  * how to formulate the inference problem for ODEs and PDEs
* PM: Lecture on "Practical ODE modelling", which covers:
  * the inherent difficulty with inference for ODEs
  * an introduction to PINTS
