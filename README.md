# Introduction to applied inference

This course contains materials for an introduction to applied inference course. The course has the following structure:

* AM:
  * Lecture on "[Basic MCMC algorithms and formulating the ODE inference problem](./lectures/applied_ode_modelling.tex)", which covers:
    * the Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm
    * how to judge convergence of MCMC algorithms
    * how to formulate the inference problem for ODEs and PDEs
  * [Problem set](./problem_sets/Morning.ipynb): writing a RWM algorithm to perform inference for the logistic model
* PM:
  * Lecture on "[Practical ODE modelling](./lectures/practical_ode_modelling.tex)", which covers:
    * the inherent difficulty with inference for ODEs
    * an introduction to PINTS
  * [Problem set](./problem_sets/Afternoon.ipynb): using PINTS to perform inference for the Lotka-Volterra model

The answers to both problem sets are [here](./problem_sets/s_applied_inference_practicals.ipynb).
